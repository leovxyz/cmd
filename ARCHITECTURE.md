# Command Menu Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of the Command Menu project, built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Overview

The Command Menu is a component featuring a dynamic search interface for interacting with a list of countries fetched from the REST Countries API.

## Core Functionalities

1. **Data Fetching**
   - Utilizes the Fetch API to retrieve country data from the REST Countries API
   - Implements error handling and data processing

2. **Dynamic Content Generation**
   - Uses HTML templates to efficiently create and update country cards
   - Employs DOM manipulation for real-time updates

3. **Search and Filtering**
   - Implements real-time search functionality
   - Filters and displays results as the user types

4. **Keyboard Navigation**
   - Custom implementation for arrow key navigation within the result list
   - Supports keyboard shortcuts for opening/closing the command menu
   - Ensures a consistent user experience across devices

5. **Responsive Design**
   - Implements a responsive layout that adapts to various screen sizes
   - Uses media queries to adjust styles for different devices

6. **Performance Optimization**
   - Uses `ResizeObserver` for efficient UI updates
   - Implements efficient DOM updates to minimize repaints and reflows

7. **Custom Modal**
   - Displays detailed country information in a custom-styled modal
   - Implements modal closing functionality via button click, overlay click, or Escape key

## Component Structure

1. **Command Menu Button**
   - Toggles the visibility of the command menu
   - Responds to click events and keyboard shortcuts

2. **Search Input**
   - Captures user input for real-time filtering
   - Triggers search functionality on input change

3. **Results List**
   - Dynamically populated with filtered country cards
   - Supports keyboard navigation and selection

4. **Country Card Template**
   - Reusable HTML structure for displaying country information
   - Efficiently cloned and populated for each result

5. **Custom Modal**
   - Displays detailed country information
   - Implements close functionality and styling

## Event Handling

- Keyboard events for shortcuts, navigation, and modal interaction
- Click events for selection, closing the menu, and modal interaction
- Input events for real-time search
- Scroll events for managing bottom gradient visibility

## Performance Considerations

- Efficient DOM updates to minimize repaints and reflows
- Use of `ResizeObserver` for responsive UI adjustments
- Event delegation for improved performance

## Accessibility

- Keyboard navigation support throughout the application
- Visual feedback for hovered and selected items

## Future Enhancements

- Implement caching mechanisms for improved performance
- Add sorting options for search results
- Integrate with more diverse data sources
- Implement lazy loading for large datasets
